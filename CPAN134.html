      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>CPAN134 is a course that offers a general understanding of web programming and design. It covers the technical aspects of interface development and teaches the essential skills required to create user friendly and interactive web interfaces. As we progress throughout the course, I along with others will incorporate CSS and JavaScript into our knowledge of HTML5, allowing us to enhance our web development skills and improve this portfolio throughout the semester. During the first week of the course, we had a detailed discussion on the history of the internet, including the milestones and technology advancements that have contributed to its growth. We learned about the importance of HTML in constructing web pages and how to structure an HTML5 document to enhance usability and navigation. We will continue to build on our knowledge of HTML throughout the course. The course also covers the creation of tables and forms, and we learned about their purposes and how to build them. We were taught how to build forms, including how to validate them and ensure that user inputs are accurate. With this knowledge it can help use create more user friendly pages that are clean and efficient.</p>

      <h3>CSS</h3>
      <p>Now we have learned CSS is a language used to style and make websites look visually appealing and easy to use. You can use it to change the color, size, and spacing of text and images on a webpage. You can also control the box model of an element, including its content, padding, border, and margin. CSS is essential for web developers to learn and there are many resources available to help you master this tool.</p>

      <h3>JavaScript</h3>        
      <p>Lastly we learned about javascript and it functions. JavaScript functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks when called. They can take parameters and return output values. Functions can make code reusable throughout a page and can use different values every time if allowed. When called the function code executes the task and returns any output values. We also touched on HTML events. They are things that happen on a web page, like clicking a button or loading the page. Common events include clicking (onclick), loading (onload), and hovering on or off an HTML element (onmouseover) and (onmouseout). JavaScript can be used to make changes on a web page, like updating text or images, and to execute code when events happen, such as clicking or loading the page.JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in one variable. You can loop through an array using for loops.if-else statements execute a block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. For example, if a is greater than b, execute code A, otherwise execute code B. Switch statements execute different code blocks based on conditions. A while loop repeatedly executes code as long as a condition is true. For instance, you can use it to increase a counter until it reaches a particular value, and the loop will continue running as long as the counter is less than or equal to the specified value. We also talked about how we can use local storage. Local storage in JavaScript is a way to store data on the user's computer. This data can be used even after the browser is closed or refreshed. It works by using the localStorage object in JavaScript where you can access this information. </p>
